  utter_AI_chatbots:
    - text:  AI Chatbots are basically 2 types
             1)FAQ type
             2)Dialog flow or orchestrated conversational type


  utter_FAQ_chatbot:
    - text: FAQ type of chatbot is the chatbot where in a user asks a question and there is only one answer. Good for websites having FAQ automated through AI chatbot. Instead of manually adding and updating FAQs, you can simply load your knowledge base to the chatbot. The chatbot parses through the information and can provide a suitable answer within seconds.

  utter_Dialog_flow:
    - text:  Dialog flow or orchestrated conversational type AI chatbot is where in the user asks a question and dialog flow is triggered for example a user asks on a retail outlet website that he wants to see white shirt. This question triggers a dialog flow of sales where in the AI chatbot asks what type of shirt i.e. formal etc, once the type is selected by the user then AI chatbot asks what type of clothing and then what size and finally showing the product landing page. This can also be applied to technical manuals, bank processes, any industry.

  utter_chatbot_customized:
    - text: Every business is built different. They have different integrations, different apps, different workflows and require customized solutions for everything.
            Our platform is just built for that. Pick and chatbot, any domain, any industry - our chatbots are ready to be deployed. And we’ll do quick customizations for you and get your bot up and running in less than 6 weeks.
            PS:- Our tech team loves to customize the bot for the most unique solutions, and they’ll be happy to customize your bot as well.
            Chatbots can collect user data and function as per customer needs and behavioral patterns with the help of AI, making the entire customer journey more personalized and customized. Mastering the art of conversation is of utmost importance.


  utter_WhatsApp_channel:
    - text: With 2 Billion+ users and an open rate of 98%, WhatsApp is the leading channel for businesses for all their customer conversations.
            Brands are using WhatsApp to generate more leads, offer customer support, answer repetitive queries, automate sales processes, and much more!
            Ecommerce stores can showcase & sell all their products online by leveraging WhatsApp commerce.
            A chatbot platform that’ll allow you to deploy on WhatsApp and generate WhatsApp links & QR codes for the customers to initiate conversations with the brand, will help you generate more sales & boost revenue.


  utter_omni-channel_deployment:
    - text: Your customer first messages you on Email.
            Then they message you on Instagram.
            Then they create a new Twitter account - and then again tag you in a Tweet.
            They’re talking about the same thing on 3 different channels. However, do your agents know that these 3 customers are the same? Do they have the context?
            99% of people who read this - answer with NO.
            That’s the problem we solve. We stitch conversations from all channels and bring them under 1 roof - so your agents have the context before they get on a call with your customer.
            WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter, Telegram - all of these have become the means of corporate survival. Being absent on social media is like turning your back on 71% of your customers. Therefore, you must deploy your chatbot across channels. Because customers can reach out to you on any platform and would love to connect with you across platforms that they use.
            KernelSphere made it easier through our dashboard, empowering conversations across 14+ channels and stitching them into a single dashboard, providing an easy gateway for your customers to engage with your business. Most chatbots are not truly omnichannel, which makes this one of the more advanced chatbot features.


  utter_live_agent:
    - text: Chatbots are advanced and smart to handle customer conversations of any nature. However, there are situations where bots fail, and human intervention is needed. In such cases, a well-defined fallback helps the bot to transfer the chat to the right human agent.
            The fallbacks need to be defined for two scenarios:- (i) when the bot finds the query complex and (ii) when users prefer to interact with the support rep.


  utter_chatbot_analytics:
    - text: Chatbot analytics can help in knowing your customers in detail and leading with data. Using this feature, a business can get a deeper understanding of the customers and make better decisions.
            With the chatbot analytics feature, you can get valuable insights and analyze all the chat conversations handled by your bot. It can help you measure the accuracy of the responses provided by bots to customers.
            By planning a successful chatbot strategy, you can measure your bot performance and assess the growth of your business.  You can leverage chatbot analytics to track relevant chatbot KPIs to make data-driven decisions and better understand the customer journey.
            Key chatbot metrics to evaluate your chatbot performance:-
            Total number of users:- The total number of users who interacted with chatbots can be traced to get insights on how many customers are using your chatbot.
            Bounce rate:- It denotes the number of users visitors who enter the website and leave without interacting with your chatbot.
            Interaction rate:-  Observing the interaction rate KPI can help you measure user engagement during conversations with your chatbot.
            Fallback Rate (FBR):- The fallback rate will capture insights about the scenarios where the bot is unable to gauge the user request and offer a relevant solution.


  utter_3rd-party_apps:
    - text: Integrate the chatbot with your preferred 3rd-party applications like Salesforce, Zendesk, Google Sheets, and more... Integrating with 3rd-party applications allows businesses to extract or workaround necessary data, analysis, and reports that are important to monitor trends and form business decisions.

  utter_flow_builder:
    - text: No, not yet, but it is there in product roadmap

  utter_multilingual_capabilities:
    - text: As the business grows globally, more and more customers expect to interact with business in different languages and dialects of their choice. And for all online stores and businesses spreading worldwide who want to strengthen customer relationships, multilingual engagement becomes a necessity. KernelSphere chatbots can converse in more than 37 international languages providing a wide array of languages to select from.

  utter_voice_conversation:
    - text: Yes it supports voice conversation and it can be used using Alexa or Google Voice etc

  utter_emotional_intelligence:
    - text: Whether the customer is angry, confused, or happy - our chatbots can understand their sentiments just like their better half would!
            Emotional connect helps brands and customers to engage with each other and build a relationship. Since chatbots are the primary interface between your business and customers, it's vital to enable or design chatbots that can build and foster relationships with customers.
            With the help of sentiment analysis, chatbots can pick up the underlying emotions and intent of customers and respond to them most appropriately. This makes sentiment analysis a critical chatbot feature
